# :see_no_evil: Blind Messenger (for Chrome)
Don't want to see someone on Messenger, but too awkward to unfriend them? Want
to temporarily block out your distracting group chat, but need to keep Messenger
open for those important friends from "work"? Low-key antisocial? Just blindfold yourself!

:sunglasses: [Install the Chrome Extension.](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions)

### Usage
1. Go to www.messenger.com and open up the conversation you want to block.
2. To find the id of the conversation you want to block, just look at the address bar and note the part after messenger.com/t/(USER ID HERE)
3. Copy and paste that user id into the small popup, save your changes, then reload the page.
4. $$$$ PROFIT $$$$

### Known issues
* Doesn't block beyond the first "set" of Messenger users.
* Doesn't work on Facebook proper
* Nasty-looking popup
